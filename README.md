4. Select "Add Entry" button to use a form to add journal entries. Submitting this form will lead to the individual journal entry that you just created.
5. You can navigate to the journal entries view by using the journal icon in the bottom navigation bar.  From here, you can view all of your past entries in a list, or view they by date via the calendar widget.  You can switch between these views using the toggle at the top of the page.

7. Use the social tab on the bottom navigation bar to view your friend's public journal entries. You can search for users from this view and follow other users (and therefore view their posts from the social feed).
